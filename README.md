# QuickTab

>This is a group project made by a few enthusiastic CSE Students from SRM Institute of Science & Technology


### Introduction

The project “QuickTab- Your Go-To Billing System” aims to solve billing problem and inventory management for small enterprises. It also aims at solving data loss issues faced by many businesses as it’s maintains an online database. The sole motivation behind the existence of this project was as follows: As of now, many corporate companies provide this service at high prices that small-scale businesses cannot afford, they also have interfaces that are not easy to operate. For eg. : if a local store owner goes for an inventory and billing system then he is supposed to pay around Rs.10k/month which isn’t feasible for most small businesses/retailers. We as a team have used the agile software engineering and project management technique to create our project. The software has been created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python(Django), Databases (SQL/ MongoDB). Benefits that’s provided by our project are : Easy to use interface, Dynamic Inventory Updates, Saves time, Affordable prices.
